# Southern Ocean Glider Observations (SOGOS)

SOGOS is a minimalistic observational campaign that was carried out in the Southern Ocean using a single [BGC argo float](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) and a two seagliders. The instrument deployment was done from [I06S cruise](https://usgoship.ucsd.edu/hydromap/) south of Africa towards the end of Austral Autumn (Apr-May). The sampling was carried out from approximately three months (May, June, July), during which the float was advected by the currents and the gliders sampled the regions around the float.

The main aim of this experiment was to get a better observational understanding of the processes controlling the upper ocean evolution and its impacts on tracer (e.g. carbon, oxygen, nutrients) ventilation.
